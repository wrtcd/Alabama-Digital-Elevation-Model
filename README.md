# Alabama Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

This repository provides a 30-meter resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the state of Alabama. The elevation data was obtained from the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and clipped to the state boundary. The dataset supports terrain analysis and geospatial modeling across a variety of environmental applications.

## Dataset Overview

- **Source:** NASA SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission)  
- **Region:** Alabama, USA  
- **Format:** GeoTIFF (.tif)  
- **Spatial Resolution:** 30 meters  
- **Projection:** EPSG:4326 (WGS84)

## Applications

- Slope and elevation modeling
- Watershed and hydrology analysis
- Terrain-informed land cover classification
- Environmental planning and hazard assessment
